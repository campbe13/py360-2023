You can read the files directly from the git server interface,  you can copy them individually, 
use the raw format if you do so. 

Or you can download everything, on the main page there is a button to download as a zip file: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1751207/149207755-39ce3c9e-033b-4309-8014-55cf0588ed05.png)

## Dev set up
### use repl.it
Follow the teacher's instructions to create an account & join the Team for this class
* [repl.it](https://replit.com/)
### Own computer (optional)
* Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) choose the latest of v3
* Use any text editor, I really like [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  on Windows or Linux so I use that as an editor
<!--
## lecture slides (for reference)
[onedrive shared](https://collegedawson-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pcampbell_dawsoncollege_qc_ca/EsJwpKt7topFqfeQXE7t2FQBBzsqeE2XbXqlYikRF0Cgcw?e=BQW4d8) material shared by the teacher, lecture slides, assignments, etc.
-->
## running the code samples 
### using an online ide (ex repl.it or other)
Create a new repl, copy the raw code to your ide, then run it.  

Note: the teacher will first use https://www.online-python.com/  for some code in class. You can use that too if you just want to see how the code runs (you cannot save it there)
<!--
### Own computer
Python is interpreted so it checks your code & runs it (provided you have installed pythn on your system see Dev set up)
For example I have a file hello.py:
```python
#  My first program
#  PCampbell
#  2022-01-12
print("hello world!")
```
Process & run it:
```bash
tricia@dc140:~/tmp$ python hello.py
hello world!
```
## clone the repo
If you are game install git and clone the whole repo, open a command prompt:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/campbe13/JavaSourceSamples360.git
```
Windows or OS X first install git bash: https://git-scm.com/downloads
