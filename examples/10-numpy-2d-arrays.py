import numpy as np

'''
consider 2d arrays 
think of it as a list or 1d array where each element is an array
so you can think of them as if they are arrays of arrays 
''' 


arr2d = np.array( [[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]])
print (arr2d)
# attributes of a numpy array
# will tell you how many dimensions
print("dimensions in array",arr2d.ndim) 
# try shape, size, dtype, itemsize, data  (itemsize in bits, individ elements)
print("element 1,2 in array", arr2d[1, 2])

-> the third parameter is a shape tuple 
- the shape indicates the number of arrays (1st  think as rows) and how may elements in each (2nd - think as columns)
