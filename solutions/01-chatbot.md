# Exercise 1 - Simple Chatbot

Using:   `input()` & `print()` functions, plus `variables` and `string literals`


Open main.py and write your code in there, be sure to start with a `#` with text to 
describe the program & one with your name ex `# sybil n. gineer`


## Our chatbot should work like this

1. Ask the user their name.
2. Greet the user by name and ask where they live.
3. Say "Oh, I always wanted to visit ", and repeat the user's location.
4. You can continue this conversation (ask about work or sports or hobbies and give a response something like things like "awesome! I like _sport_ too! where you repeat what they input)

Remember to use the user's name in all responses for maximum creepiness!
