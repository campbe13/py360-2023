# Instructions  

  In this lab you will calculate the distance to the sea bed by calculating the angle opposite to &#952;    (writing your own function optional here)

  ## Steps
  
  1. Ask the sea captain for the length of their anchor cable and the angle that they observe by their boat (example shown cable 30m, angle input 51 degrees (so opposite is 39))   (input)

  1.  Calculate the depth `d` to the seabed using the appropriate trig functions in the math module   (determine the formulae you will need for this ) (calculations)

1. Display the depth with 2 decimal places  (output use a format string)
2. Create 2 sets of test data, note them as comments at the top of your code (choose input, calculate the expected result)
   
## Analysis first (algorithm, then code)
1. Analyse the problem (understand it)
2. Decide what input you need, what formulae you need, and what you need to output.
3. Figure out the steps that you need to take to solve the problem  (I gave you some)
4. Draw a flowchart, or write it in English (pseudo-code)
5. Choose data for test cases for each problem (input + expected results) this means that you have independently figured the output when you use the test case data as input.
      
* Hint: to display 6 decimal digits of variable x `f' {x:.6f} '`
