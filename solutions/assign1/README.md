# Answers for Assigment 1

Note the answers I gave here are just the code, they are missing the required:

1.  comment at top explaining the file  
2.  1x set of test data

## note, no comments to the contrary
## problems seen
1. bad variable names
2. missing comments @ top
   ```
   # describe what this code is doing
   # you may need a few lines
   # your name
   # date
   ```
2. comments that explain what can be read from code 
   ```
   # define the function
   def angle():
   ```
3. missing test data (not for guess though you could have chosen 2x outside your range, ex 1 & 999)
4. function name changed 
4. swapping the order of the parameters given for the function
