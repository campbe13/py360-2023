# Answers for Assigment 1


Note the answers I gave here are just the code, they are missing the required:

1.  comment at top explaining the file  
2.  1x set of test data

## note, if you got no feedback, you had
1. comments at the top explaining the file
1. 1x set of test data at least
1. good variable names
3. comments where needed (though see problems for bad comments)
1. solution implemented & passed the tests (you can run them now if you want)
## problems seen
1. bad variable names
2. missing comments @ top
   ```
   # describe what this code is doing
   # you may need a few lines
   # your name
   # date
   ```
2. comments that explain what can be read from code 
   ```
   # define the function
   def angle():
   ```
3. missing test data (not for guess though you could have chosen 2x outside your range, ex 1 & 999)
4. function name changed 
4. swapping the order of the parameters given for the function
